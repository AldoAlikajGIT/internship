Hello,
This is my firt javascript project.
It is a website that allows users to book appointments with their care takers. THey must register and sign in in order to access appointments. Each appointment is unique meaning that no two people can have the same appointment, becausae that would create a timetable contradiction. Each user must have a distinct email adress. 
I used react for the front-end and express for the back-end. It is configured by being devided into 2 main parts: the public(front-end) folder and src(back-end) folder. In the public folder there are a few files containing the html,css and javascript of the whole page and its functions. In the src I placed the connetion to the database and the logic between the communnication of the front-end and the database. I used MySQL for the database.
If you encounter any error I apologize. As i said earlier this is my first javascript project so please take that into consideration :).
